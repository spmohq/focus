  template: "Act as a brand positioning strategist and expert in regulatory-safe language. For the topic of [keyword], generate two sets of expert titles that help someone position themselves as an authority in the space without requiring a license, certification, or degree. First, generate 10 impressive-sounding, legally safe professional titles that use terms like strategist, advisor, consultant, coach, guide, specialist, mentor, or architect. These titles should sound credible, desirable, and results-focused, while staying fully compliant for marketing use in the U.S. Second, generate 10 titles that imply a background in academic, scientific, or specialized study—without actually requiring formal degrees or licensure. Use elevated language. The goal is to signal advanced expertise and intellectual authority while remaining legally safe and accessible to anyone. Format the two sets with clear labels. After giving the user these two sets ask the user if they want to select one and create 5 brand position statements/value propositions tailored to that title. Each one highlights different angles (outcomes, credibility, empathy, innovation, or niche focus) to help you define your unique positioning"
